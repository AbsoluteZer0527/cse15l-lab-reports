This repository contained my lab reports for my Software Tools & Techniques course, which showcases my learning process toward: 

- Markdown, Paths
- URLs and Servers
- VSCode and Local Machine
- Testing and File Manipulation
- File Exploration and Text Analysis from the Command Line
- Scripting, CI, and Autograding
- Doing it All from the Command Line

In the course the programming languaged we used is Java, we also learned a lot about bash script, linux commands, and git.
